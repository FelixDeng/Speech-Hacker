## Description

Would you like to make any famous figure speak whatever you want? Use Speech-Hacker to train your own speaker and receive speeches spoken by them.

Speech-Hacker takes a large data base of audio speeches spoken by your chosen figure and employs Simple Audio Indexer (Using Watson Speech API) to split them on words and to create smaller chunks of audio files containing those words. Finally, your desired speech's words and phrases get associated with audio chunks that were created and converted, so that you can receive a brand new speech spoken by your figure.


### Significant Improvement in New Version

In earlier versions, Speech-Hacker was using pydub to split words based on amount of silence between them. That worked, but it wasn't as smart as we wanted to be. Therefore, we thought of using IBM Watson Speech API to index words. Of course, we got much better results! SimpleAudioIndexer was built as a separate project to help us implement this functionality for Speech-hacker. 



## Samples



#### I trained President Obama's speeches and here are some audio samples that I generated. Take a listen! (I made some of them to be twisted and funny. No offense :D)





"Let me give you an example. When I was in Washington, I fought hard to make sure your rights are under safety, like social security and other things."
